# Food-Text-Generator
This app creates text captions for food images which can be used for maintaining social media of a restaurant.

A user can pass up to 9 photos as input which are then categorised into one or several food classes. After that, the information is formatted and passed to an OpenAI model which generates a corresponding text caption.
