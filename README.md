# Food-Text-Generator

This app creates text captions for food images which can be used for maintaining social media of a restaurant.

A user can pass up to 9 photos as input which are then categorised into one or several food classes. After that, the information is formatted and passed to an OpenAI model which generates a corresponding text caption.

## How to run the app locally üßë‚Äçüíª

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slavafive/Food-Text-Generator.git app
cd app
```

2. Install yarn and run the frontend application:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will start the frontend application at _http://localhost:3000_.

3. Set the OpenAI API config key in [api/config/config.yaml](https://github.com/slavafive/Food-Text-Generator/blob/master/api/config/config.yaml) file

```yaml
open_ai_key: "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

*Note. You can view your OpenAI API keys by logging in at [openai.com](https://openai.com), then choosing API in the central menu, then clicking the avatar on top right corner and choosing the option "View API keys".*

4. Navigate to `api` directory and create a virtual environment there:
```bash
cd api
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Launch the backend application (from the `api` directory):

```
sudo flask run
```

7. Now you can go to _http://localhost:3000_. in your web browser and generate text captions!
